### TradeProcessor Debt Code

This Repo holds the  C++ code to convert a CSV file containing TradeRecord data to an XML file. The code seems to violate certain clean code priciples. Review and Identfy code smells and refactor the same . 

> This project uses the Gtest  framework to test functionality.

#### The task
- Code coverage is low. Expand the tests to take care of the   variations. Track and improve the coverage.

Hint: Test the abstractions, instead of just end-to-end tests.

Uncovered lines indicate an opportunity to write tests.

Caution: High coverage doesn't indicate no bugs!
- Cognitive and Cyclomatic Compexity is High
